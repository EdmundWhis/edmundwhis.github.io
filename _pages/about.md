I am a PhD student in [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche](https://www.imj-prg.fr/) and [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/).

My research interest includes operator algebra, geometric group theory, K-theory and non-commutative geometry.

You can find my CV here: [Shuoyu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
