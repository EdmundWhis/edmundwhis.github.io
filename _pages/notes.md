Project 22
======

**Project 22** is a personal initiative aimed at organising and digitising my academic notes, primarily in mathematics. It includes the original notes from lectures and discussion sections, as well as a growing collection of informal mathematical essays and exploratory writings that often lack a fixed format or clear categorisation. These essays reflect moments of curiosity, insight, and sometimes confusion, captured during my learning process.

Please note that all documents in Project 22 are **CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0**-licensed.

There are several notes published on the column [Project 22](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1147569183884824576) Zhihu, a Chinese forum that is still one of the few Chinese platforms suitable for discussing mathematics.

Here is a list of the topics:

Mirage Project
======
**Mirage Project** is a curated, long-term initiative to compile and restructure learning materials in mathematics. This project emphasizes structure, clarity, and interconnectivity. It integrates content from multiple courses, as well as insights, blog posts, and lecture notes shared by fellow researchers and the broader mathematical community online.

At its core, Mirage Project is a personal attempt to build a coherent and navigable knowledge archive. Materials are selected and reorganised around central ideas, recurring themes, and natural logical flow, rather than the order in which they were originally presented. Topics that span across different areas or courses are often brought together in unified, restructured chapters.

The project is ongoing and evolving. As my understanding grows, so too does the structure of Mirage. It is both a snapshot of current insight and a dynamic document meant to be refined over time.

Here is a list of the materials that has completed or has been planned, indexed by academic year. All the materials would be written in **Chinese**.
* Notes collection of academic year 2022/23: Analytic *K*-Homology and Index Theory.
* Notes collection of academic year 2021/22: [*C\**-Algebras, *K*-Theory and Other Topics](../assets/notes/2021_22_Collection.pdf).
